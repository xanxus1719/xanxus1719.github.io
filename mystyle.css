        <h1>Whispers of the Journey</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="first-word">In</span> gardens where dreams whisper to the dawn,<br>
            The journey of life, through <span id="p1-night">night</span> to <span id="p1-light">light</span>, is drawn.<br>
            Through joy and pain, in every breath, a new song,<br>
            Life's beauty unfolds, in the dance, we belong.
            <br><br>

            <span class="first-word">By</span> rivers of time, under stars that guide,<br>
            Strength and courage bloom, with love at our side.<br>
            In each ending, a beginning, in silence, a call,<br>
            Embrace the moments, the magic in us all.
            <br><br>

            <span class="first-word">So</span> here's to the paths we choose to roam,<br>
            Finding the wonder in this place we call home.<br>
            With each sunset, a promise, in the melody of prose,<br>
            The future awaits, where our dreams compose.
            <br><br>
